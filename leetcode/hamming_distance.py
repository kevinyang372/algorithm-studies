# The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

# Given two integers x and y, calculate the Hamming distance.

# Note:
# 0 ≤ x, y < 231.

# Example:

# Input: x = 1, y = 4

# Output: 2

# Explanation:
# 1   (0 0 0 1)
# 4   (0 1 0 0)
#        ↑   ↑

# The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.
